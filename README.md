Lisp-Life
=========

Conway's Game Of Life written in common lisp.

Install
=======

This Project uses quicklisp, make sure you install that from "http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/".

Also, you may need to install sdl_gfx. This package is under a different name in different distro's, make sure you locate that package first.

Finally just load the file in sbcl or another CL implementation and enjoy! 

Usage
=====

After loading in the file, (complied or not) you need to do two things 
to get the simulation running. First you will need to load a starting 
pattern. All starting configurations are generated by functions prefaced 
with "init-".

Current patterns are:

"rpen" ~ The famous R-Pentomino pattern

"ggg" ~ Gosper Glider Gun

"diehard" ~ Short lived pattern that simply dies out

"acorn" ~ Another well known pattern that exemplifies many oscillators 
and still-lifes

"blse" ~ An example of a simple, block laying switch engine

"pulsar" ~ Pulsar 3-period oscillator

"pdh" ~ Rare 15 period oscillator

Once you have initalized a pattern, simply start the simulation using 
the "gol" function. "gol" also takes an optional parameter for delay 
between generations (mesured in seconds).

After that, you should see a window containing the simulation appear. 
Just sit back and watch.
