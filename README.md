Install
=======

This Project uses quicklisp, make sure you install that from "http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/".

Also, you may need to install sdl_gfx. This package is under a different name in different distro's, make sure you locate that package first.

Finally just load the file in sbcl or another CL implementation and enjoy!
